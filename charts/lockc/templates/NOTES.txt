lockc installed SUCCESSFULLY

lockc provides three policy levels for containers:
  * baseline - meant for regular applications
  * restricted - meant for applications for which we need to be more cautious and secure them more strictly
  * privileged - meant for part of the infrastructure which can have full access to host resources
